I remember several of the men in the county jail warning me not to take a deal with 'Life' on the end of it, because whether it was 7 to Life, 15 to Life, or 25 to Life, the governor was not letting lifers go and 'Life' would mean my whole life. In the end, I chose to go against their advice and accepted the district attorney's  plea  bargain offer for  16 to Life. This was an  excruciating decision, but it came down to the fact that no matter how badly I wanted to avoid prison, I was guilty and knew it.

They will also ask questions to determine if I have gained insight into the causative factors that led to my crime, what I've done to address those issues, and my plans for making sure it never happens again.  I learned very early on what an uphill climb lay in front of me from the other lifers who had already received several denials from the board.  For the most part, the guys in the county had been right. Only a handful of lifers were being found suitable for release, and even some of them had their dates taken back by a reversal of decision from the governor.

Imagine serving a 15 to Life sentence and then going to the board and receiving a 15-year denial that's equal to your time in. The constitutionality of this law is being challenged in the courts,because it essentially lengthens prison sentences ex post facto.
